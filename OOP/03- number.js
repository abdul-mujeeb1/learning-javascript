var a = Number(5);
console.log(typeof a);
var b = 5;
console.log(typeof b);

a == b // true

// b.toString() 
// as we see vairable b is primitive type but funny thing we have access
// to methods like same for Number answer is JS internally 
// call a constructor function of Number 
// technically in JS every thing is object wehave constructor functions
// for everything like null, undefined or new Date() it pretty usefull for us
