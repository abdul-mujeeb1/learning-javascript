# Promaming paradigms

- Functional and Object oriented programing are programming paradigm that allow us to organize code which is easy to reason about.

- Easy too extend and mantain
- Memory Efficient
- keep code DRY

# OOP
- Bringing together the data and its behaviour in a single location.
# Functional prgrammming
- it has different concept of data must be seprate from its behaviours.
- so we have multiple boxes as said to be functions instrad of single box like in OOP (box here is simple for example only)
