Sure, here are some questions to test your knowledge about the spread and rest operators in JavaScript:

1. **Rest Operator in Functions:**
   - What will be the output of the following code?
     ```javascript
     function multiply(multiplier, ...numbers) {
       return numbers.map(number => number * multiplier);
     }

     console.log(multiply(2, 1, 2, 3)); 
     ```

2. **Spread Operator in Function Calls:**
   - How would you use the spread operator to pass the elements of an array as individual arguments to a function `Math.min`?

3. **Rest Operator in Object Destructuring:**
   - Given the following object, how would you use the rest operator to extract the `name` property and collect the remaining properties into another object?
     ```javascript
     const person = { name: 'Alice', age: 25, job: 'developer', country: 'USA' };
     ```

4. **Combining Arrays with Spread Operator:**
   - How can you combine two arrays `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]` into a single array using the spread operator?

5. **Copying an Object with Spread Operator:**
   - Given the object `const user = { name: 'Bob', age: 28 };`, how can you create a new object that copies all properties from `user` but also adds a new property `role: 'admin'`?

6. **Rest Operator in Function Parameters:**
   - What is the difference between the following two function definitions?
     ```javascript
     function example(a, b, ...rest) { }
     function example2(a, ...rest, b) { }
     ```

7. **Spread Operator in Array Literals:**
   - What will be the output of the following code?
     ```javascript
     const arr1 = [1, 2];
     const arr2 = [3, 4];
     const combined = [0, ...arr1, ...arr2, 5];
     console.log(combined);
     ```

8. **Rest Operator in Object Destructuring:**
   - What will be the content of the `rest` variable after the following code is executed?
     ```javascript
     const { name, ...rest } = { name: 'Charlie', age: 30, role: 'designer' };
     ```

9. **Using Both Rest and Spread Operators:**
   - How would you write a function that takes an object as a parameter, adds a new property to the object, and returns the updated object using both rest and spread operators?

10. **Error Handling:**
    - What will be the result of the following code, and why?
      ```javascript
      const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };
      const { ...spreadObj, c } = obj;
      ```

Feel free to answer these questions, and I can provide feedback or explanations as needed!

-----------------------------------------------------------------
ANSWERS ATTEMPT:
1- [ 2, 4, 6 ]
2- const arr = [2,45,67,89]; 
Math.min(...arr)
console.log(Math.min(...arr))
3- const {name, ...otherObject} = person;
4- const arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
const arr2 = [4,5,6]
console.log([...arr1, ...arr2])
5- {role: 'admin', ...user}
6- example function takes 2 parameters a & b and then remaining alls in one array of rest 
and example2 function error bcz Rest parameter must be last formal parameter
7- [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
8- { age: 30, role: 'designer' };
9- function assignRole(obj) {
    const updatedObj = {...obj, role: 'admin'};
    return updatedObj;
}
console.log(assignRole({user: 'Abdul', id: 34}));
10- Error! reason is rest element must be last here it is doing extraction
